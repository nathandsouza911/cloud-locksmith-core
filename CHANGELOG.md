# Changelog

## Unreleased

* The scheduler is now off by default (`ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false`). The demo and the
  documented `.env.example` already turned it off, so they behave as before; any other
  install that relied on the old default must now set `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true`.
* Stale service principal findings are saved (they failed with "unsupported
  resource_type").
* The permanent role assignment control queries Graph once per privileged role; Graph
  rejected the previous multi-value filter.
* After a Preview-only sign-in, routes that need live directory data return 409
  `FULL_CONNECT_REQUIRED` instead of 500, and Simulate Fix shows that reason.
* A Microsoft sign-in refused because the tenant already has an owner now says so on the
  login page (without naming the owner) instead of showing a bare login page.
* In the demo, a refused fix shows a plain message where you clicked.

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-12)

First open-source release of Cloud Locksmith Core, extracted from a private codebase.

* 27 identity and Conditional Access controls, posture score and history, risk feed,
  attack paths, approval-gated remediation with preflight checks, verification and
  rollback, MSP fleet view, baselines, campaigns, evidence reports, and an OAuth app
  consent review workflow.
* Read-only demo mode (`docker compose up --build`), with a recorded scan of a fictional
  tenant and guards that keep it away from Microsoft and real tenants.
* A single database baseline (`20261110_baseline`) for fresh installs. Databases from the
  private predecessor are not supported.
* Removed from the predecessor: paid plans, quotas and billing, the Marketplace
  (AppSource) sign-up, the marketing and legal pages, the terms-of-service gate, and
  unused modules.
* Fixed while extracting: dependencies pinned (and `greenlet` added); the two risk-based
  Conditional Access controls now require an Entra ID P2 licence; four controls that the
  capability map always blocked are now available behind approval.
